This is a demo project to showcase some simple SASS stuff.

Instructions
------------
In order to use this project template, just run:
> npm install

This will install all the required modules and cause the folder 'node_modules' to be created.

After the download of dependencies completes, just run:
> npm run watch

This will enable the listener: any changes to the files in the project will trigger node to compile the SASS code and save an updated version of the stylesheet file at assets/css/style.css.

.scss files are commented and will point to the reason why these files are there and how to divide the code.
